## Overview

The **Health Insurance Claim Prediction** project aims to predict the likelihood of a claim based on various factors. The model is trained using a machine learning algorithm that considers historical data and other relevant features to make predictions.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and normalizes the dataset.
- **Model Training**: Uses a machine learning model to predict health insurance claims.
- **Flask Web Interface**: A simple web application to interact with the model and make predictions.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
Running the Jupyter Notebook
The project includes a Jupyter Notebook (Health Insurance Claim Prediction.ipynb) that contains the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.

## Model Deployment
The model can be deployed using Flask, which provides a simple web interface for making predictions.

## Making Predictions
Once the Flask server is running, you can navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your web browser to use the web interface. Enter the required input parameters and click "Predict" to see the model's output.
