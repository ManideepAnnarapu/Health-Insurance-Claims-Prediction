## Overview

The **Health Insurance Claim Prediction** project aims to predict the likelihood of a claim based on various factors. The model is trained using a machine learning algorithm that considers historical data and other relevant features to make predictions.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and normalizes the dataset.
- **Model Training**: Uses a machine learning model to predict health insurance claims.
- **Flask Web Interface**: A simple web application to interact with the model and make predictions.
